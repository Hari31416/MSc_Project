We show that this interaction can be used to efficiently generate a quasi-continuum of very closely spaced harmonics and explain how such a scheme can be implemented experimentally. We show how the generation process can be described in terms of the beat frequencies between the two fields. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the - interaction (which has been studied extensively elsewhere).}

  title     = {Relativistic high-order harmonic generation by a femto-second radially polarized laser pulse irradiating a ring plasma grating},
  journal   = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
  abstract  = {A novel scheme for generating relativistic high-order harmonics by a relativistic radially polarized laser interacting with a plasma annular grating is proposed. The particle-in-cell results show that the radial laser field can drive the relativistic electron bunches to oscillate radially in all azimuth directions, resulting in the emission of strong harmonics. Firstly, the interference of the laser field on the plasma grating structure significantly enhances the radiated harmonics which match the phase conditions. Secondly, due to the common ring symmetry of the grating structure and laser polarization, the transverse distribution of harmonics presents a Bessel form, and there is a sharp bright spot in the center with relativistic intensity. Such high-intensity short-wave structured harmonics have broad applications in areas such as plasma diagnostics, high resolution imaging and detection.}

  journal   = {Plasma Science and Technology},
  abstract  = {High harmonic generation (HHG) by two-color counter-rotating relativistic laser pulses with arbitrary frequency ratio is investigated through particle-in-cell simulations. It is shown that the dichromatic laser driver at various frequency ratios can effectively produce high-order harmonics with different spectral features. A general selection rule of this extended scheme can be obtained and the corresponding harmonic helicity can be identified through a simple analytical model based on a relativistic oscillating mirror. Thus, the results in this paper may offer new opportunities for arbitrary spectral control of generated harmonics, which is of significance for diverse potential applications in practice.}
