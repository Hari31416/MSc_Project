<h1 id="introduction-and-motivation">Introduction And Motivation</h1>
<p>There is great interest in high intensity physics where the study of
interaction of light with matter at Ultra High Light Intensity (UHLI) is
performed. The main goal is to achieve high intensity which give access
to novel physical regimes.<span class="citation"
data-cites="henri"></span> Intensity of laser in order of <span
class="math inline">10<sup>23</sup> <em>W</em>/<em>c</em><em>m</em><sup>−2</sup></span>
has been reached experimentally with the CoReLS petawatt (PW)
laser.<span class="citation" data-cites="highintensity"></span>. The
next step is to push forward these intensities above <span
class="math inline">10<sup>25</sup><em>W</em>/<em>c</em><em>m</em><sup>−2</sup></span>.
Above this limit, quantum electrodynamics effects start playing a major
role on the dynamics of electrons. Intensity level of <span
class="math inline">10<sup>29</sup><em>W</em>/<em>c</em><em>m</em><sup>−2</sup></span>
corresponds to the Schwinger field. At this field, light starts
generating electron positron pair out of vacuum. Vacuum starts acting
like a nonlinear medium and its refractive index becomes a function of
light intensity. These physical regimes are barely, if at all, explored
in lab.</p>
<p>One way to get these UHLI is by using plasma mirrors (PM). When a
laser pulse is incident upon plasma, it reflects if the density of
plasma is high, forming PM. Upon reflection from plasma the laser field,
because of pondermotive force, propels a relativistic oscillation of the
PM which results in periodic temporal compression of the reflected field
(Doppler effect). These oscillations results in generation of high
harmonics of the incident laser frequency.<span class="citation"
data-cites="lichters"></span> Experiments have been performed showing
generation of high harmonics of order up to 141st of Nd glass laser<span
class="citation" data-cites="hormonics1"></span>, 109th of Ti sapphire
laser<span class="citation" data-cites="hormonics2"></span>, and 37th of
krypton fluoride laser<span class="citation"
data-cites="hormonics3"></span>.</p>
<p>Here, the generation of harmonics of incident laser pulse by
interaction of a high intensity laser pulse with a step boundary
overdense plasma layer is studied and the effect of variuos parameters
on the generated high hormonics is investigated. For this, fully
relativistic particle in cell simulations are performed using
<em>EPOCH</em>. Already, variuos experiments and simulations have been
performed to study how high hormonics are changed by using different
polarization of laser pulse <span class="citation"
data-cites="polarization1"></span> <span class="citation"
data-cites="polarization2"></span>, different PM shapes <span
class="citation" data-cites="henri"></span>, two color laser pulses
<span class="citation" data-cites="two-color1"></span> <span
class="citation" data-cites="two-color2"></span>. In this article, we
study the effect of plasma density, laser intensity, envelope and pulse
duration on generated high harmonics.</p>
<h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1>
<p>The simulation uses <em>EPOCH</em>, a parallised, second order and
fully relativistic implementation of particle in cell algorithm.<span
class="citation" data-cites="EPOCH"></span> Though <em>EPOCH</em> is
implemented in 3D, the current simulation is performed in 1D3V only.</p>
<h2 id="simulation-parameters">Simulation Parameters</h2>
<p>We want to study the effect of various plasma and laser parameters on
the generated high harmonics. The parameters which are constant
throughout the entire experimentation are these: The simulation box
extends for <span
class="math inline">40<em>λ</em><sub><em>l</em></sub></span> (from <span
class="math inline"> − 20<em>λ</em><sub><em>l</em></sub></span> to <span
class="math inline">20<em>λ</em><sub><em>l</em></sub></span>), where
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub><em>l</em></sub></span> is the
laser wavelength taken as <span
class="math inline">1<em>μ</em><em>m</em></span> and has total 16000
cells, i.e., 400 cells per wavelength. The plasma is placed at <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 0</span> and with a thickess of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub><em>l</em></sub></span>. Number of
particles per cell are 100. For most of the simulations the pulse
duration is <span class="math inline"><em>T</em> = 20<em>τ</em></span>
and simulation is run till <span
class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>d</em></sub> = 40<em>τ</em></span>.
Here <span class="math inline"><em>τ</em></span> is the time period of
laser pulse.<br />
Some parameters in the simulations are varied to observe their effect on
high harmonic generation. These are listed below:<br />
<strong>Laser Envelope</strong>: Three laser envelopes are used. They
are:<br />

             &amp; 1-t/T \text{ for } T/2 \leq t \le T  \\
             &amp; 0         \;      \text{ otherwise }
        \end{cases}$$</span> <strong>Plasma Density</strong>: The ratio
of plasma density to the critical density is varied as <span
class="math inline">7</span> and <span
class="math inline">4</span>.<br />
<strong>Normalized Vector Potential</strong>: Normalized Vector

<h1 id="result-and-discussion">Result and Discussion</h1>
<p>A number of simulations are performed to study the effect of various
parameters discussed above on the generated high harmonics. The results
are presented in the following subsections.</p>
<h2 id="effect-of-plasma-density">Effect of Plasma Density</h2>
<p>Increasing plasma density decreases the number of harmonics
generated. The amplitude of the harmonics also decreases. The Figure <a

<h2 id="the-plasma-oscillations">The Plasma Oscillations</h2>
<p>In this section, we give some simulation results related to the
oscillation of the PM surface.</p>
<h3 id="effect-of-laser-intensity-on-electron-oscillation">Effect of
Laser Intensity on Electron Oscillation</h3>
<p>The electromagnetic field of high intensity laser beam with plasma
makes the electrons inside the plasma oscillate. These oscillations
become more and more intetense as the intensity of the EM field
increases. (See the Figure <a href="#fig:oscillation1"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:oscillation1">5</a>)</p>
<h2 id="the-frequency-of-oscillations">The Frequency of
Oscillations</h2>
<p>We found out that the frequency of oscillations is even harmonic of
the frequency of the incident laser pulse. Furthermore, electrons are
oscillating only till they are interacting with the laser field. (See
the Figure <a href="#fig:oscillation2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:oscillation2">6</a>)</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Frequency of electron oscillations during

</figure>
<h2 id="theoretical-considerations">Theoretical Considerations</h2>
<p>We use linearly polarized laser pulse and the pondermotive force for
this case <span
class="math inline">∝ (1−<em>c</em><em>o</em><em>s</em>(2<em>ω</em><sub>0</sub><em>t</em>))</span>
which drives the plasma surface twice the laser frequency. We conclude
that density is even function. Starting from Maxwell’s equation and
combining this with equation of motion we get, For normal incidence
<span class="math display">$$\left (\partial^2 -
\frac{1}{c^2}\partial_t^2\right )a = \left (\frac{\omega_p}{c}\right
)^2s(x,t)$$</span> where <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is
the vector potential, <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> is the
source term and <span
class="math inline"><em>ω</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> is the plasma
frequency. If we assume incident light to be linearly polarized in the
z- direction, the source term is given by <span
class="math display">$$\label{source}
        s(x,t) =
n(x,t)\sqrt{1-\beta_x^2(x,t)}\frac{a_z(x,t)}{\sqrt{1+a_z^2(x,t)}}$$</span>
Since we are using overdense plasma the major part of the incident light
is reflected and the vector potential <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub><em>z</em></sub>(<em>x</em>,<em>t</em>)</span>
decays rapidly inside the plasma. This can be approximated by <span
class="math display">$$\label{a_z}
        a_z(x,t) \approx \begin{cases}
            -2\mathbf{a_0}\sin(kx-\theta)\sin(\omega t) \; &amp; \text{
for } x &lt; 0   \\
            \mathbf{a_s}\exp(-x/d_s)\sin(\omega t)  \;     &amp; \text{
for } x \ge 0
        \end{cases}$$</span> where <span class="math inline">$d_s =
(c/\omega_p)\sqrt{1-(\omega_0 / \omega_p)^2}$</span><br />
<br />
Now, the density <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>t</em>)</span> is even
function. <span class="math inline">$\sqrt{1-\beta_x^2(x,t)}$</span> is
also an even function while <a href="#a_z" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="a_z">[a_z]</a> is odd function, hence the source
function Equation <a href="#source" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="source">[source]</a> is an odd function. So, normal
incidence of lineraly polarized light will generated only odd harmonics.
Even harmonic can be found if we use different polarization. <span
class="citation" data-cites="lichters"></span></p>
<h1 id="current-status-and-future-plan-of-work">Current Status and
Future Plan of Work</h1>
<p>The interaction of high intensity laser pulse with overdense plasma
is investigated. During this, odd harmonics of the incident laser pulse
is generated and the effect of variuos laser and plasma parameters on
the hormonic generation is studied. Morever, it has been observed that
the relativistic oscillations of the PM surface has frequency which are
even harmonics of the incident laser pulse. Future plan of work is to
study about the effects of some more parameters on the harmonics
generation escpecially the effect of oblique incidence, different
polarization of the laser pulse as well as some more laser
envelopes.</p>
