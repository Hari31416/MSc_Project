\section{Results and Discussion}

% \subsection{Tools Used}
All the plots in this sections are made by the authors using matplotlib\cite{matplotlib}. We would like to acknowledge NumPy\cite{numpy} and SciPy\cite{scipy} for providing the necessary tools to vizualize, preprocess and derive meaningful insights from the simulations.

\subsection{Normal incidence}
In this section, we will discuss the results of the simulations for normal incidence. A number of simulations are performed to study the different laser and plasma parameters on the generated HHG and the plasma oscillations. We will first start by discussing how overdense and underdense plasma behaves in presence of relativistic and non-relativistic laser pulse.

\subsubsection{Preliminary Analysis}

The goal is to study the transmittence and reflectance of the laser pulse in underdense and overdense plasma for relativistic and non-relativistic case. For this, we define a term calling it the \textit{reflectance} as:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:reflectance}
    R = \frac{{E_{b}^2}-{E_{a}^2}}{{E_{b}^2}}
\end{equation}

where $E_{b}$ is the sum of y component of the electric field at a node before the plasma starts and $E_{a}$ is the sum of y component of the electric field at a node where plasma just ends. This way, the above relation gives a indication of the ratio of the intensity passing through the plasma to the intensity getting reflected.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{reflectance.png}
    \caption{Plot of reflectance (see \ref{eq:reflectance}) with different ratio of $n_c$ and $n_0$ and vector potential $a_0$. Black dotted line represents the ideal behavior.}
    \label{fig:reflectance}
\end{figure}

The ideal curve for the interaction of laser pulse with underdense and overdense plasma is also shown in the figure with black dotted line. Ideally, when the ratio $r = \frac{n_0}{n_c}$ becomes 1, the reflectance also becomes 1. However, when the laser becomes relativistic for $a_0 \ge 1$, the particles inside plasma starts to oscillate with relativistic velocity, gaining mass. This results in change in the plasma frequency and hence the laser does not get reflected even for density greater than the critical density corresponding to the non-relativistic case. So, there is a shift in the critical density due to relativistic laser pulse.

Next, the plot of these oscillation of plasma surface with time is also shown for different values of vector potential (Figure \ref{fig:density_oscillations}). The plasma density is taken to be critical density, i.e., $r=1$. The laser pulse, after interacting with electrons, makes them oscillate. If the pulse becomes relativistic, the oscillations becomes strong and hence the plasma surface oscillates with relativistic velocity.


This completes the preliminary analysis of laser-plasma interaction. In the next section will discuss about effects of various laser and plasma parameters on the HHG generation.

\subsubsection{Effects On Generated HHG}
This section shows results which were obtained by varying the laser and plasma parameters.

\subsubsubsection{Effect of Plasma Density}
No significant effect of plasma density on generation of high harmonics is observed. However, a resonace is observed at plasma density of $4n_c$ giving more harmonics at that density (See figure \ref{fig:density}). This resonace is because the plasma frequency is equal to the frequency of the driving pondermotive force. (Since $F\propto (1-\cos{2\omega t})$)

    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{density.jpg}
    \caption{Resonance at $n = 4n_c$}
    \label{fig:density}
\end{figure}

\subsubsubsection{Effect of Laser Intensity}
Increasing the laser intensity increases the number of harmonics generated. The amplitude of the harmonics also increases. The Figure \ref{fig:intensity} shows the effect of laser intensity on the harmonics generated.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{intensity.jpg}
    \caption{Laser intensity and the harmonics generated.}
    \label{fig:intensity}
\end{figure}


\subsubsubsection{Effect of Laser Envelope}
The laser envelope does not seem to have any effect at all. See the Figure \ref{fig:env}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{env.jpg}
    \caption{Effect of the laser envelope on the harmonics generated.}
    \label{fig:env}
\end{figure}


\subsubsubsection{Effect of Pulse Duration}

Increasing the pulse duration increases power within the pulse which then increases the number of harmonics generated. The harmonics also become more pronounced in amplitude. The Figure \ref{fig:pulse} on shows the effect of the laser pulse duration on the harmonics generated.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{pulse.jpg}
    \caption{Effect of the laser pulse duration on the harmonics generated.}
    \label{fig:pulse}
\end{figure}

% \subsubsection{The Plasma Oscillations}
% In this section, we give some simulation results related to the oscillation of the PM surface.

%     \caption{The effect of laser intensity on electron oscillations}
%     \label{fig:oscillation1}
% \end{figure}

% \subsubsection{Laser Intensity and the Electron Oscillation}
% The electromagnetic field of high intensity laser beam with plasma makes the electrons inside the plasma oscillate. These oscillations become more and more intetense as the intensity of the EM field increases. (See the Figure \ref{fig:oscillation1})


\subsubsubsection{Super-Gaussian Envelope}

The SG envelope, given by equation \ref{eq:sg-env} has a different area for different $p$ and hence has different energy for the same given intensity. To mitigate this, the simulation is performed by multiplying the given intensity of the pulse such that the total energy of all the pulses is the same. This is done by taking a reference SG beam (we have used $p=2$), evaluating its area and then normalizing the intensities of other SG pulses by the ratio of this reference area and the area of the corresponding SG envelope. The spectrum of the HHG generated using laser pulse with SG envelopes with power 2, 4, 6, and 8 are shown in figure \ref{fig:sg}. It is observed that a small increase in the amplitude is followed by increasing power of the SG envelope.

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{sg.png}
    \caption{The spectrum of SG envelopes with power 2,4,6, and 8 are shown in a single plot. A small increase in the peak amplitude is observed with increasing power.}
    \label{fig:sg}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{The Frequency of Plasma Oscillations}
We found out that the frequency of oscillations is even harmonic of the frequency of the incident laser pulse. Furthermore, electrons are oscillating only till they are interacting with the laser field. (See the Figure \ref{fig:oscillation2})

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{oscillation2.jpg}
    \caption{Frequency of electron oscillations during different times}

\subsection{Oblique Incidence}

\subsubsection{p-Polarization}

%     \label{fig:p-fft}
% \end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:p-s-fft} shows the spectrum of HHG in the L-frame, when p-polarized light is incident on the plasma. As discussed in section \ref{section:selection} (see the table \ref{tab:selection-rule}), the spectrum is made up of even and odd p-polarized harmonics. There are no s-polarized harmonics.


\subsubsection{s-Polarization}
The L-frame spectrum of HHG is depicted in diagram \ref{fig:p-s-fft}, with plasma being exposed to s-polarized light. As explained in section \ref{section:selection} (see the table \ref{tab:selection-rule}), the spectrum comprises odd s-polarized harmonics and even p-polarized harmonics.
