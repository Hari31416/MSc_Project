% \section{Future Plan of Work}
% We plan to continue our research on high harmonic generation. Up till now, we have performed just 1D simulations. We plan to extend our simulations to 2D so that we can compare the results of the oblique incident in 1D to that of 2D.

\section{Acknowledgment}
We would like to extend our sincerest gratitude to Professor Vikrant Saxena for his unwavering support, patience, motivation, enthusiasm, and invaluable guidance. His mentorship and leadership have been instrumental in the success of this project, and we feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with him.
