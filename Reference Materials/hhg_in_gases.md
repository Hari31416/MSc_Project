Firstly, Multiphoton and tunneling ionization are two limiting cases of the universal process of nonlinear ionization and this process is determined by three
parameters â€” the laser frequency $\omega$ , the amplitude of the
laser field strength F, and the atomic ionization potential $E_i$

1. Multiphoton ionization: In the multiphoton limit the ionization rate depends on the field strength according to the power law: $$\omega = F^{2K}$$ where K = <$E_i$/$\omega$ +1> is the number of absorbed photons

2. In the tunneling limit the ionization rate increases exponentially with the field strength $$\omega \propto  \exp(-2(2E_i)^{3/2}/3F)$$

Secondly, it was shown that the boundary between multiphoton and tunneling ionization is determined by the value of the so called adiabaticity parameter: $$ \gamma =\omega \sqrt{2E_i/F}$$ if $\gamma^{2} >>  1$ correspond to multiphoton ionization; this process is realized at a relatively high frequency and low field strength of laser radiation. Oppositely, the values of $\gamma^{2}<<1$ correspond to tunneling ionization, which is realized at a low frequency and high field strength.

For example, the first convincing observations of tunneling ionization were obtained using IR radiation of a CO2-laser with frequency $\omega$ approx 0:1 eV
