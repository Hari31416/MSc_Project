The core algorithms of ZPIC are implemented in C, and all of the codes can be run as pure C codes, with no external dependencies. To get started with running ZPIC simulations from C be sure to check the [Getting started](start) page.

## Documentation

* [Getting started](start)
* [Initializing particle species](particles)
* [Writing diagnostic output](diag)
* [Using laser pulses](laser)
* [Setting a moving simulation window](movwindow)
* [Using electric current smoothing](smooth)

## Examples

ZPIC also includes several C code examples, be sure to check the `input` directory in each of the ZPIC C code directory.
